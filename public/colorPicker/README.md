ColorPicker
==============

RBG/Hex color converter that displays your colors

This converts both from RGB to Hex as well as the other way around

To convert from RGB to Hex:
Either:
  - Enter your RGB values into the text boxes and the Hex value will be displayed
  - Use the sliders to find a hue of your choice
  
To convert from Hex to RGB:
  - Enter your hex value into the label text box (either with the # or not) and the RBG values will update as well as the background

This will also display the name of the closest color your current selection courtesy of Chir.ag (http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/#6195ED).
